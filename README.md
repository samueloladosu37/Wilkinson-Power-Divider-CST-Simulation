## 📘 About Power Dividers

Power dividers and directional couplers are essential components in RF/microwave systems. They allow signal power to be:
- Divided equally (or unequally) between ports
- Combined from multiple sources
- Matched at all ports in well-designed configurations

### Key Types of Power Dividers:
- **T-Junction**: Simple, lossless, but no isolation
- **Resistive Divider**: Matched ports but lossy and low isolation
- **Wilkinson Divider**: Matched, isolated, and lossless when output ports are matched — ideal for practical systems

## 🧠 Why the Wilkinson Divider?

The **Wilkinson power divider** is unique because it:
- Provides **equal (3 dB) power split**
- Maintains **perfect matching** at all ports
- Ensures **high isolation** between output ports
- Appears **lossless** when outputs are terminated in matched loads

It accomplishes this by using:
- Quarter-wave transmission lines
- A resistor between output ports to absorb reflected power
